IDEAS
-----
Rank countries/states using - 'sightings per capita'
			    - 'contact hours per capita' [using Duration]
			    - 'summer-winter divergence' [you expect sightings to be uniform]




COMMENTS
--------
California has experienced more UFO sightings than every country outside of the U.S. combined.

Colouring is proportional to LOG(COUNT+1). Combined with a diverging palette, countries with a
COUNT of 1 are made brown and the rest are on a seemingly separate, sequential palette.

NUFORC website launched in June 2001.

The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program ran from 2007 to 2012.
After its start we observe a marked increase in reporting, even compared to the boost from the website's launch.
We also see a sharp decline in reporting shortly after its termination.

Three days of note: July 4th and February 29th.
July 4		The clear explanation here is that people mistake fireworks for UFOs lmao
February 29	While NUFORC vets all reports and ensures they're not pranks, this is likely a quirk in the data
		that doesn't mean anything.
November 7	???

Datetime entries with missing time are imputed at midnight on the dot. There were 3,062 missing entries and no
original entries at 00:00:00 exactly. All 00:00:00 entries are therefore NaTs.

DATA CLEANUP
------------
Probably the dirtiest dataset I've ever seen.
Basically they're all treated as freetext fields, clearly no validation occurs at the recording stage of collection:
-	"Duration" is given textually (e.g. "1 second", "3 minutes").
-	"Time" has sporadic "-1" entries.
-	"Comment" text is encoded horrifically.
-	"Country" is a mess:
		A)	Nonsense entries including but not limited to:
			   "4 miles at sea"
			   "?!?!"
			   "dont know"
			   "military report"
			   "jacksonveil"
			   "ingerland!"
			   "between; mountain top"
			   "Viet Nam"
		B)	Misnomers and reduplicates:
			   "Papua/New Guinea"
			   "U.K." and "United Kingdom" and "United Kingdom uk"
			   "Trinidad/Tobago" and "Trinidad and Tobago" and "Trinidad & Tobago"
			   "Brasil"
			   Loads of "Republic of"s and "Rep. of"s;
				"Republic of Ireland"
				"Republic of South Korea" ???
-	Lat/long missing for countries outside of English-speaking North America. Cannot speak to their veracity.
